"""Scoring logic: turn a candidate's answer into a rubric-based scorecard.

>>> THIS FILE IS WHERE MOST OF THE WORKSHOP HAPPENS. <<<

In this START state, POST /score is not wired to any of it yet (see app/main.py).
During Module 3 you will, with Claude Code:
  * build    -> implement score_with_openai() and wire /score to score_answer()
  * test     -> write tests pinning  total == sum(category scores)
  * debug    -> those tests reveal the BUG in compute_total()      (marked below)
  * refactor -> clean up the messy format_scorecard()              (marked below)
